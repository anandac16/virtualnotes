(2, 'Lipsum Notes', 'Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\r\n\r\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.', '', 'anandac16', '2017-09-19', 'lipsum-notes'),
(3, '[Shuumatsu] V5 C5 Can I Lie Next to You?', '<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Normal, everyday life is always on the verge of coming to an end. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The repetition of each single day, all on the verge of the end, forms that normalcy. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Sometimes newcomers may enter, but at the same time others must leave. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Changing ever so slightly bit by bit, it continues all the way up until that moment when it meets its true end. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The newspapers reported the attack by a group of Beasts to be the doing of The Order of Annihilation Service History. Owing to their already widespread reputation as a group of violent troublemakers, the news naturally became assimilated and believed within the population.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">As for what kind of transaction took place between Elpis and Collinadiluche, and the Winged Guard too, no one knew. Morally speaking, spreading the truth would have been ideal, but, in the worst case scenario, that could lead to a war. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">However, if nothing else, the Elpis National Defense Force suffered a major loss of influence as a result of the incident. There was also apparently a large change of personnel in the higher ups of the Winged Guard, so it’s safe to say that Elpis won’t be able to pull off anything similar anytime soon. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">—It’s also worth mentioning that in one corner of that newspaper, there was a small article reporting the discovery of the transformed corpse of an Orc on the outskirts of Collinadiluche. </span></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Elq Harksten returned home. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">This fact literally shook the 2nd Floating Island, a consecrated land and also the most secretive place in all of Regul Aire. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“WaaaaaaaahhhhhhhElqqqqqqqqq” wailed a giant black skull. The One who Sleeps in Death. The One who Shines Darkness in the Garden of Light. Known by various over the top sounding names, Ebon Candle, one of the three Poteau, threw away any shred of dignity and simply wailed and wailed. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">A strange light flickered on and off violently in the insides of his hollow eye sockets, and his lipless teeth clattered together vigorously. “I’m I’m so glad you’re ssaaaffeeeeeee.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Shut up you useless oaf,” scolded a huge red floating fish. Also one of the three Poteau, Carmine Lake swam around the surrounding air restlessly, making no attempt to hide her irritation. “In the first place, what the hell have you been doing for five hundred years!? I mean, I understand that you used the master’s soul to protect the world and all, but, after all that time, how have you not made any progress on the star boat’s repairs!?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“W-What am I supposed to do!? Look at me! I don’t even have enough power to repair my own physical body.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“That’s just because you’re wasting your energy! Just sink this stupid floating island already!”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“You think I could do such a thing!?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Both of you, be quiet!” screamed Elq, sandwiched between the two gods. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“But Elq, if we don’t hurry up and get this guy to regain his power and undo the curse, you’ll be in that half dead body forever, you know? Don’t you want to return to your original form as quickly as possible?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“T-That’s a little optimistic, but…” Ebon Candle commented.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“I’m fine,” Elq said.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Huh?” “Hm?” The two gods raised confused voices. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“I’m fine like this.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“W-W-Whyy!? If you don’t properly come back to life, even if we fix the star boat, your body won’t be able to handle riding on it, you know? You won’t be able to leave this world, you know?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“I won’t go anywhere. I kinda like this world.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“No no no! This world is coming to an end! There’s hardly anything here! It’s only a matter of seconds before there’s nothing at all!”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“But, there’s still a few seconds left.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Where did that attitude come from!? Hey, Ebon Candle, you say something too!”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“H-Hm?” The skull’s teeth clattered confusedly as he was suddenly drawn into the conversation. “Did you meet some nice people while living on the floating islands?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“… yes.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“I see I see. Find a special someone you’re interested in?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“……… no, not exactly.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Wait a second! What kind of questions are you asking!? And what kind of answer is that!?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“He’s only the slightest bit handsome. Kutori and Leila lowered their standards too far.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“I see I see.” Like a kind and gentle old man, the skull chuckled softly and nodded repeatedly. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Around them, the floating fish circled and circled, wailing about this and that. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Meanwhile, Nephren gazed blankly at their exchange. Carmine Lake still hadn’t acquired a physical form or whatever, instead residing in a part of Nephren’s mind. However, as long as Nephren stayed in this special barrier surrounding the 2nd Island, Carmine Lake could move and act freely within the boundaries. She mentioned something about the island being an archive of models of the primal world, so it could mix together the mind and body, but Nephren didn’t really understand, and Carmine Lake never explained in more detail. Nephren wished she had a book. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Kaiya,” she said to the young Ayrantrobos lady, Ebon Candle’s servant. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Yes, Miss Nephren?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“What’s for dinner tonight?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“I haven’t decided yet, but, since the fruits from the summer garden have been good, I’m thinking of making something with those.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Okay, I’ll help you out later,” Nephren said, then started to leave the room.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Where are you going?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“To Willem.”</span></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The corpse of Willem Kumesh had been carried to the 2nd Floating Island and stored in a deep, secluded place. Ebon Candle suggested that they place him in ice again, but Elq and Nephren rejected that idea. Instead, they placed him on a decoratively and neatly arranged bed, where he now lay dead, almost as if simply in a peaceful sleep. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“… are you cold?” </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nephren touched Willem’s hand. Cold. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Are you lonely?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">She touched his cheek. Cold as well.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">She wanted to put a blanket over him, but, of course, doing so would have no meaning. She wanted to lie next to him and nap, like she often did back then, but, again, doing so no longer had any meaning. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Ebo said it wouldn’t be that hard to revive him.” When she got there Nephren didn’t notice, but Elq stood in the doorway. “He’s the same as me. If Seniolis’ curse is loosened just a little, he’ll become not-a-corpse just a little and come back to life.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“As a Beast, though, right?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Of course, but you wouldn’t mind, right? You’re a Beast too, after all.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“It’s meaningless.” Nephren shook her head. “Hogging a broken Willem all for myself wouldn’t bring me any joy. I don’t…” She thought a little. “I don’t want to bring him unhappiness.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Hmph. You have bad taste too,” Elq said, unimpressed, and stepped inside the room. Then, cheerfully, she lied down next to Willem. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“What are you doing?” Nephren asked.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Resting.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Why here?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“No particular reason. I just feel sort of calm here… ow!”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Pulling her by the ear, Nephren dragged Elq off of the bed and continued straight out the room.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“No sleeping together.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Why not why not!? We’re both corpses, so it’s not a problem, right!?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“That’s my assigned seat. I won’t give it up to any corpse or god.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“This is tyranny!”</span></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Inside a dream, he could see the orange of the twilight sky as the sun sank below the pitch dark horizon. He stood upon a small foothold which seemed to be made of tightly packed ashen hexagons. Besides that foothold, only an empty black nothingness lay below. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Only the half disappeared evening sun and the barely remaining foothold existed here. Nothing else. It was an aged world, on the verge of the end, on the verge of perishing.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In that place, there stood a young man. With nothing to do nor think about, he simply gazed blankly at the sinking sun. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Suddenly, the young man noticed a presence beside him: a small crystal lump lying on the ground. </span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">What is this</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">? As he looked at it, the lump began to emit a clattering noise then split, swelled, bent, shrunk, and, in the end, took a shape very similar to that of a person. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">—</span><i><span style="font-weight:400;">Ah, I see</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">. </span></p>\r\n<p><i><span style="font-weight:400;">This is the Beast inside of me</span></i><span style="font-weight:400;">, the young man realized. It was none other than the half of his being which awoke after he swallowed the fragments of the Shiantor. How many hundreds or thousands of years he didn’t know, but he must have been neighbors with this thing for as long as human history. However, they never knew each other before. They never even noticed each other’s existence. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Hey, you,” he called out, but it didn’t budge. “Nice to meet you… that sounds kinda weird. Since we’ve been together this whole time and all.” Still no response. The Beast simply stood still, not looking at anywhere in particular. “Sorry for always ignoring you. You’re something like a victim too, huh.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">As before, still no response. Instead—</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“—Yo.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Hearing a familiar voice, he turned around. There, illuminated by the fading scarlet of the sky, he found the ambiguously aged, nostalgic face of a man. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Good-for-nothing master.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Looks like you’ve been through a lot. Have any regrets?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“So many I can’t count.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Glad to hear it.” Taking a seat next to Willem, Nils chuckled. “That’s proof you led a fulfilling life until the very end.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Willem didn’t think it was anything to laugh about. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“I finally understand. These guys just wanted to go home,” he said as he looked at the crystal lump beside him.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Hm?”’</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“They just wanted to reclaim that ashen sea. The Visitors stole it. Moreover, they stole it because they longed for home themselves. As a result of that clash of homesicknesses, the land fell into ruin, and those who lost their home were driven up to Regul Aire. Everyone just wanted to return home. Just wanted to reclaim.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The movements of the sun shook Nils’ shadow ever so slightly. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“There’s no need for evil to destroy the world. It always begins with a small wish that no one would ever find fault with. Such a tiny thing leads so simply to the end.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“You’re right. This world is already done for,” Nils said as he scratched his head. “It’s almost time for me to get going as well. I can only stop in a world and use my power as a Visitor six times, and I used the last one to seal your memories. Now I need to look for a new world and start another journey.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“… so you were a Visitor, huh.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It should have been a shocking fact, but Willem wasn’t particularly surprised, perhaps because of his mind’s extreme exhaustion, or perhaps because, from the start, he realized that no matter what this man’s true identity was it wouldn’t be the least bit surprising. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Want to tag along?”</span><span style="font-weight:400;"><br>\r\n</span> <span style="font-weight:400;">“Huh?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“This world is already coming to a close. You are dead, and there’s nothing you can do. So how about going to a new realm with me? If all turns out well, you might be able to life an easier life. At the very least, you’ll be able to life a more meaningful life than just being dead for an eternity here.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Ah…” Willem thought for a bit. “So in other words, you’re telling me to become a Visitor too?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Nils nodded bitterly.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“That sounds fun.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“I think you could be fine no matter where you went.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Maybe.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It was tough losing home. Painful. But he was able to stand back up. He was able to think of a new place as home. That experience and those memories had now become precious assets to him. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“In the end, I couldn’t do a single thing for you or this world. So this is the last thing I can do for you as a good-for-nothing master,” Nils said, gesturing to the crystal lump with his eyes. “Right now, you guys are just barely separated. I can leave the Beast here and bring just you along.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Ahh… that’s what you were talking about, huh,” Willem said as he scratched his head. “Sorry, but, I can’t go.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“I see.” Nils nodded. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Losing my home, losing my place to return to, it’s been painful and miserable. But still. It’s always possible to find somewhere new. Anyone can.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Those valiant people who call Regul Aire home were once residents of the land. How much blood was shed before they were able to accept their new home?</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“But it doesn’t go well if you try to rush things. It takes time,” Willem continued. “Standing back up after the pain of loss. Meeting someone new. Getting used to a new place. They all failed at those. The Visitors, and the Beasts too. They tried to reclaim their homeland all in one go, so they chose the wrong method. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Well, at first I couldn’t realize either. But, if you try raising your head and actually looking around you, sometimes, right beside you, there’ll be someone to teach you.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Willem closed his eyes. In his case, who stood right beside him? Grick, Naigrat, Nephren, … Kutori. They taught him so much it almost seemed wasteful. They saved him, who had been thrown out even farther past the end of the world. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“I want to be by this guy’s side.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“You’re saying you want to talk with it? That’s impossible. Your mental structures and modes of life are different, you know?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“I know. I’m not dreaming that big.” In a friendly gesture, Willem wrapped his arm around the crystal lump’s shoulder (?). “These guys can’t see anything except the world of their home. Only what they’ve lost is in their field of view. That’s why they can’t accept Regul Aire, and why they’re so desperate to demolish us.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">It’s frustrating, isn’t it? That’s why I want to do something for them. Putting aside the past, something strange is beside me now. I want to help them think that.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Are you stupid?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“I’ve been starting to suspect that myself lately.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The two of them laughed together one last time.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“You really are a busy guy, worrying about an ended world even after you’re dead.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Well, it seems that’s all I can do, seeing as I could never become anyone.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“… ah—” As he began to say something, Nil’s silhouette suddenly began to blur. “That’s fine too, isn’t it? It’s like you.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“I’ve been started to suspect that myself lately as well.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">With that, their conversation came to a halt. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Sitting side by side, the two of them gazed blankly at the evening sun. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Suddenly snapping out of his trance and looking to his side, Willem saw that no signs of Nils were anywhere to be seen. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">He was now all alone with the crystal lump, the fragment of a Beast’s delusional convictions, in this ending world.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“… well, it looks like we’re going to be together for a while.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Willem lied down. Enough space remained on the foothold for that. Above, there was nothing, not even the night sky.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Oh yeah, it’ll be inconvenient if you don’t have a name. Should I give you a nice one?” he said leisurely, then shut his eyes.</span></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">—A short while after. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Hey! Wait, Eudea!”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Oh, close one!”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Two girls sprinted down the hallways of a broken down house. The floor seemed like it could collapse at any moment, but, both of them having grown used to that, the two girls ran at full speed, skillfully dodging the particularly dangerous looking spots. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Tonight’s dinner is a celebration for our seniors coming home, so you can’t snack beforehand. I told you that, right!?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Well, it just smelled so delicious. Almita, your cooking really is good! I’m sure our big sisters will be very pleased, mhm. Of course I’m very pleased too.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Aah you really are annoying! Let me spank you once!”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Nope!”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The building shook with their rapid footsteps. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Both of you, be quiet.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“What, are those two at it again?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Hey hey, let’s make a bet. Who do you think will win today?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Ooh, good idea. I bet tonight’s dessert on Eudea getting away.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Okay, then I’ll be the opposite… Tazeka, you want to join too?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Hm? Ah… then I’ll bet on Kana. Also tonight’s dessert.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Eh, why? This is about Eudea and Almita.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Yeah, I can see that.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Poking their heads out of windows here and there, the girls watched the pair’s escape drama.</span></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“—Today’s lively as always, huh.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Elsewhere within the same house, in the reference room, a blonde haired lady sitting in a wheelchair laughed cheerfully. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“It kicks up dust, so I’d wish they wouldn’t run around so violently. The big cleaning we just did is going to waste.” While flipping through a bundle of documents, a pink haired lady laughed back. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“That’s the fate of this run down lodge. I think it could really use a nice renovation sometime soon.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“That’s true.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The pink haired lady, Naigrat, put a finger to her cheek and tilted her head. It is often said that the true age of a Troll rarely reveals itself on the outside. As if to prove that stereotype, Naigrat’s appearance had hardly changed since those times. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Memories are engraved all over the place, so whenever I think about hiring workers, I stop at the last minute. Do you remember the notches on the cafeteria wall? From when Noft and Lantolq used to compare heights.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Ah, when they made marks too often and we couldn’t tell which marks belonged to who anymore.” The blonde haired lady smiled with a nostalgic look in her eyes. “Speaking of them, does it look like they’ll be able to come home this year?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like it’ll happen. Their current job is pretty far away.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Ah, that’s too bad.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">A lot happened. For example, the rules restricting the fairies’ freedom were loosened, some with conditions attached. As a result, a few fully grown fairies were now living outside the fairy warehouse. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Lantolq held an unofficial position at the Orlandri Trading Company managing any affairs related to the fairy warehouse and Dug Weapons. On the other hand, Noft acted as a sort of part time soldier for the Winged Guard, accompanying salvager voyages to the land to ensure their safety. Both were working hard far, far away from the 68th Floating Island. They couldn’t be called home so simply. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“… oh yeah, how about Collon and the others? Are they back yet?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Eh? No, not yet. It should be sometime in the evening.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Oh, well then it must have been unrelated. A little while ago, I thought I saw a non-civilian looking airship land in the harbor district.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“A little while ago? That’s strange, I haven’t heard anything about it.” Naigrat tilted her head again. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Just then, a soft knock sounded at the door, and a girl peeked her face in. “Excuse me, Naigrat and Aiseia. Have you seen Riel?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The two women looked at each other. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“No. Why?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“I can’t seem to find her anywhere. If she went off to play in the forest again that’s dangerous, so I got a little worried.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">A rather thick forest surrounded the fairy warehouse, complete with pools of water in hard to see places. For the inexperienced or young children, it could be pretty risky terrain. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Oh no! I need to go find her!” Thrusting away the documents in her hand, Naigrat immediately stood up. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“I don’t think we need to worry that much. Aren’t you being a little overprotective?” Aiseia commented.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Being overprotective is the special privilege of a guardian!” Naigrat said with almost a shout, then dashed out of the reference room.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Umm… what should I do?” The young girl left behind said with a confused look. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“I don’t think you need to worry.” Aiseia shrugged.</span></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Kana! What are you doing?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Hehe. Taking advantage of this delicious situation.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“W-Wait a second! Wait there to be spanked!”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Ah… I guess Tazeka wins the bet.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Hmm, I never thought I’d actually be right.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Waaait!”</span></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“… the place really is lively, huh.” Aiseia, left all alone in the reference room, smiled with a tinge of melancholy. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Still seated in her wheelchair, she reached out and touched the glass pane of the window. Once, long ago, he and she had been there, beyond that window, that young man and young girl who dashed restlessly through that short-lived time of the end. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“A lot’s happened, but I’m doing pretty well.” They were no longer here, so Aiseia had no choice but to voice her report in the vague direction of the blue sea above. “What about you guys? Where are you? What are you doing?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">However, the sky, ever so high and infinitely vast, only sucked up her words, returning no answer.</span></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">A girl fell out of the sky. Judging from her figure, she was probably a little younger than ten. She must have taken a wrong step while walking on a tree branch, for she was currently plummeting downwards head first. At that rate, she would no doubt have a violent collision with the hard ground, leaving a scene unfit for a peaceful spring afternoon.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Uh oh.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The young man stretched out his hands and tried to catch the girl. However, right as he did so his feet slipped, causing him to completely lose balance and fall over with a crash. As a result,</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Ahggh!?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">He ended up stuck under the girl’s body and let out a shriek similar to a crushed frog’s.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“… ouch.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“S-Sorry!!” After a few second’s delay, the girl, seeming to have grasped the situation, jumped away in a panic. “A-Are you hurt!? Are you alive!? Are any organs crushed!?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Ah—I’m fine. I’m tougher than I look.” Wiping the dirt off his clothes, the young man stood up. “But I did get pretty filthy. Are you oka—”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">He looked at the young girl. She had blue hair the color of a clear sky and eyes with the deep color of the calm ocean surface. He felt like he had seen her before.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“—Hm?” The two of them locked eyes and froze. “Have I met you somewhere?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“N-No? I don’t think so… probably…” The girl tilted her head. “I’ve never left this island, and you’re not from around here, are you?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Ah—well, it’s been a while,” he answered vaguely. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Since you’re walking on this path, I assume you have some business with our warehouse?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Yeah.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Well then, you’re our guest. Follow me, I’ll be your guide.” The girl whirled around and started walking off with a mature step. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The young man gazed blankly at her back. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“What’s wrong?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Ah… it’s nothing.” Scratching his head, the man started walking after her. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Riel!” A voice sounded from the direction in which they were headed. It drew closer. “Riel… ah! There you are!” A tall woman came jogging over. “Don’t make me worry like that. How many times do I need to tell you that you can’t go into the forest alo…”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Sorry, but, ah, there was a strange animal, well, it got away, but I chased it all the way up that tree, and…”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The girl’s explanation, ambiguous as to whether it was an excuse or a brag, cut off midway. The woman wasn’t looking at her. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“No… way,” the woman murmured with a quivering voice, both hands covering her mouth. “No… that can’t be…”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Sorry. I’ve been away for a pretty long while.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Eh? Eh? Eh?” The girl, unable to comprehend the situation, rapidly looked back and forth between the young man and the woman. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">However, the two didn’t explain anything, instead simply exchanging gazes, as if some mutual understanding had passed between them and only them.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“I’m home,” the man said.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The woman’s eyes opened wide, blinked, then began to fill with tears. Her expression turned into a jumbled mixture of crying and joy. Then, with a trembling voice and many pauses, she managed to reply,</span></p>\r\n<p><span style="font-weight:400;">“Welcome… back!”</span></p>', '5c84b768b2bb2969390f02460b634ce7.jpg', 'anandac16', '2017-09-20', 'shuumatsu-v5-c5-can-i-lie-next-to-you'),
